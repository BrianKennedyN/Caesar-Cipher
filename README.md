# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 2,
A would be replaced by C, C would become E, and so on.
